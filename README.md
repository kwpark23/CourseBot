## <a name="intro"></a>Research Description 

This summer, I attended the study group for students who were interested in machine learning, led by Lisa Zhang, who is a CS professor at UTM. I decided to work on a research project to learn a how machine learning can be used to solve real world problems. After choosing **chatbot** as my research topic, I read up various articles to learn about it in detail, built a simple chatbot to understand how it works, wrote up instructions for other students to build their own chatbot, and presented about my research in front of other students and Lisa.

## <a name="background"></a>Background Information
I want to start with basic introduction to chatbots, then talk about how they work, and finally talk about how chatbots apply machine learning.

### <a name="intro2"></a>Introduction to Chatbot
Here is the simple definition of chatbot: It is a software system or program designed to interact with humans through chats.

You have probably seen chatbot in its various iterations: As AI speakers, message boxes, and humanoid robots. Any software that understands human language and responds appropriately can be identified as chatbots. 

The first chatbot was created quite some time ago. It was named Eliza and it simulated conversation with humans using regular expressions. Now chatbots uses regular expressions as well machine learning to do NLP.  

Chatbots are being used more and more by companies because unlike human operators, they are available 24 hours at fraction of cost, they have access to large amount of data, and their performance is quantifiable.

### <a name="work"></a>How chatbots work
Building a chatbot requires identifying the following four things: 
  - Understand target audience: college students, consumer of the product, businessmen/women, or some other category of users.
  - Understand the natural language of communication: Is the user asking question in English, French, Chinese, Spanish, and so on?
  - Understand the intent or desire of the user: Is the user asking about book recommendation, restaurant search, booking hotel, how to use software?
  - Lastly, you want your chatbot to provide appropriate response to user’s question.

Chatbot is also about simulating conversation between humans, so there are fun aspect of making a chatbot, like adding personalities. 

Now, let’s discuss how a chatbot process human language. When you type some text into your chatbot, generally it looks for two things: intents and entities of the sentence. **Intent** is the broad description of what a user is trying to say and **Entity** is data classification from information the user provided. For example, if a user entered, "I want  to book a flight from Toronto to Seoul.", intents could be 'Flight_booking' and 'Flight_search'. As for entities, phrase, "book a flight" could be categorized as Booking ,and "Toronto" and "Seoul" could be categorized as Location.

Problem with identifying intents and entities is that human language has a lot of ambiguity. There are many ways to say the same thing. And classifying sentences by hand will take really long time. This is where machine learning comes to the rescue!

### <a name="apply"></a>How chatbots apply machine learning
I mentioned that in the old days, chatbots were built using regular expression and pattern matching. Now, chatbots are trained using word vector models. 

Simply put, word vector model transforms English words into n-dimensional vectors in space. The model uses angles between vectors to identify similarity between them. This is called cosine similarity, uses number between 0 and 1, with 1 having similar orientation and 0 having different orientation. For example, cat-dog will have higher cosine similarity than cat-can, because cat-dog are both animals. You train the model using training data set. Next, you improve the accuracy of the model by tweaking parameters to the model. Lastly, you feed new dataset that the model have never been exposed to before and train it further. Doing this from scratch takes a lot of data, time and computer power. Better idea is to use existing libraries with trained word vectors.

Here are a few popular machine learning libraries available for Python. You can use spacy for NLP, Scikitlearn for ML implementation and data analysis. The third library called Rasa_NLU is developed by company specializing in chatbots. It combines functionality of both spacy and scikitlearn. Below are links to each of the libraries:

  -  spaCy [installation](https://spacy.io/usage)
  -  Scikit-learn [installation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
  -  rasa_nlu [installation](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/)

## <a name="learn"></a>Learning about chatbot
I took a Datacamp course called, "Building Chatbot in Python" [link](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-chatbots-in-python) to better understand how to make a chatbot step-by-step. 

The note I compiled while studied up on chatbot can be found in the Jupyter notebook named, "Python Chatbot Project".

## <a name="python"></a>Building a chatbot using Python
The first way to build and deploy a chatbot is by using Python programming lanugage. This involves two things: Having a simple chatbot code to simulate conversation and deploying it to Facebook Messenger by connecting to localhost server using **flasks**, **requests**, and **ngrok** modules/program.

More detailed instruction can be found in the Jupyter notebook named, "Deploying Python bot on Facebook Messenger". 

However, I had two problems with this approach: First, chatbot Messenger becomes inactive when close your localhost server. If you want to reactivate it, you have to manually enter new localhost server address. Second, there was a challenge to manually set up machine learning aspect to my chatbot using one of the machine learning libraries.

## <a name="dialog"></a>Building a chatbot using Dialogflow

To solve the issue of machine learning library implmentation, I used Dialogflow, a chatbot-building platform developed by Google. Dialogflow had two benefits over Python version: First, it trains your chatbot automatically once you define intents and entities using built-in NLP. Second, your chatbot Messenger stays active even after you close Dialogflow window. 

More detailed instruction can be found in the Jupyer notebook named, "Building chatbot with Dialogflow". 

The chatbot I built using Dialgoflow can be found [here.](https://www.facebook.com/CourseBot-2303590903189187/?view_public_for=2303590903189187) This chatbot answers questions regarding computer science courses at UTM. User can ask questions like, "Who is the instructor for CSC301?", "What courses does professor Lisa Zhang teach?", and "What are the prerequisite for CSC301?". 

I also had a problem using this approach: I had a difficulty figuring out how to make chatbot remember user's previous input to respond to user's future requests. For example, if user is ordering from Pizza-order chatbot and type, "My favorite pizza is pepperoni and my second favorite is pineapple", then type, "I want to place order for my second favorite pizza", how would the chatbot knows what user meant by 'second favorite'?

I learned a great deal about chatbot from my summer research project. I learned how chatbot can automate tasks formally done by people and make data access more convenient for people who use it. Also, I learned machine learning can be used to make chatbot more intelligent by recognizing structural difference of user input. Lastly, this is my on-going project, one in which I plan to improve on once I have a better understanding of machine learning concept.
