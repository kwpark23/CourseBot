    "## 1. The Brief\n",
    "Imagine if you can build a chatbot using tools that exists already and be able to deploy it on Facebook Messenger for public to use. Won't that be cool?\n",
    "I'm here to show you how to set up and train a chatbot that is suited for your purpose and connect it to Messenger. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setting up Dialogflow account\n",
    "Dialogflow is a platform for creating multi-purpose chatbots by Google. You don't need coding knowledge to make a chatbot on Dialogflow. \n",
    "Go to the link [here](https://dialogflow.com/) and click on `Sign up for free` to create your account. Once you have created your account, sign in with your account. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Creating your first chatbot\n",
    "Click `Go to console` or `Create a new agent` buttons to make your first chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialogflow console is divided up into 3 main sections. Section 1 has all the options for navigating to different pages. Section 2 is where you will interact the console to train your chatbot. Section 3 allows you to test your chatbot after you have trained it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are ready to create your chatbot, type in the name of your chatbot in `Agent Name` box and click `Create` button. I have created a new book suggestion chatbot called 'BookBot'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Enabling Small Talk\n",
    "Before you do anything, you want your chatbot to be able to carry out small talk with user. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled2.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First, nagivate to `Small Talk` page from nagivation pane. Second, click on `Enable` button to enable small talk for your chatbot. Finally, click `Save` button to save the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Testing your chatbot\n",
    "On the far right, you will be able to test your chatbot by typing in phrases. Click on `Try it now` and type in greetings. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled3.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you will be able to see what the user typed and your chatbot's default response. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Creating Entities\n",
    "Now, it's time to customize your chatbot for your specific purpose. You want to navigate to `Entities` page and click on `Create Entity`. Entities are used to identifying data correctly from information user provided. For example, if user typed 'I want mushroom on my pizza', mushroom is the topping on the pizza. So, we want to add 'mushroom' to entity called, 'Toppings' to recognize it as pizza topping. We can also add 'pineapple', 'pepperoni', 'pepper' and any other pizza toppings under entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my BookBot, I am going to create two entities: 'Authors' and 'BookTitles'. I got the list of authors and book titles from Indigo [website](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/summer-reading/?ref=shop%3ahome%3ahome-main%3a01-hp-hero-summer-reading%3ahero&cl=01-hp-hero-summer-reading_hero). When you are entering reference values, you want to enter things user might mention when using your chatbot. When your chatbot recognizes those things from user's phrases, it will tag those words with entities you have created. Make sure to enter variation of what user might ask for as synonyms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have entered your reference values, click `Save` to train your chatbot. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled4.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled5.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Creating Intents\n",
    "This is where things get interesting. You want your chatbot to be able to process user's question and reply with appropriate response. Intent is a broad description of what a person is trying to say. For example, if the person asks, 'I'm looking for a Mexican restaurant in the center of town', intent is \"restaurant search\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Go to `Intents` page and you will see a lot of options to choose from. For now, we are only interested in `Training Phrases` and `Responses` sections of the page. Also, if you want specific entity to be present in user's intent, under `Action and parameters`, check `Required` box next to the entity of your choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the intents I am going to create is called `Karen Swan`. When the user searches for a latest book by Karen Swan, I want to make a suggestion of her book. In `Training Phrases` section, you want to type in as many phrases as you can think of that a user might ask. In `Responses` sections you can type a list of responses you want to give to user's question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Trainig Phrases` section, you can manually assign an entity by highlighting a part of the phrase and selecting an entity of your choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled6.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "Here, you can see an intent I created for when user searches for Karen Swan books.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled7.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "Here, you can see an intent I created for when user asks for book suggestions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled8.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "Here, you can see all the intents I have created for my chatbot. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Testing your chatbot\n",
    "Finally, the fun part! Now is the time to test if your chatbot is working correctly. Enter a few phrases you have trained your chatbot for and see if you get the responses you expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled9.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "Here, I typed, 'make me a book suggestion' and got the response, 'How about Broken Throne: A Red Queen Collection by Victoria Aveyard', which is exactly what I trained it for. Seems to be working!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can train your chatbot further by adding more entities and intents. More you train it, more diversity in responses your chatbot can have.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Integrating with Facebook Messenger\n",
    "Now, we know our chatbot is working so we want to deploy it on Facebook Messenger. Click on `Integrations` tab from navigation pane and click on Facebook Messenger to turn it on. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled10.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click on Facebook Messenger link, you will see an instruction on how to deploy it. What we need is a Facebook Access Token. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\Untitled11.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to head over to Facebook Developer website."
